    "HowItWorks": "How it works?",
    "HowItWorksText": "Each translation process has its own order of operations. For example, in the first step, the translator reads the text (gets familiar with it). After that, he/she makes a draft of the translation. In the final step, the translator reads his text and makes changes (edits his translation). Realizing that each ethod of Bible translation has its own materials for each of these steps, we decided to create a platform where the translator could simply go to the project page and see only what he or she needs at that particular step. Depending on the method, the content of the tools varies.",
